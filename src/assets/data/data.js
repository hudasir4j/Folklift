      desc: "It was a blazing Summer day when I stepped into the clothing store, preparing for the school year. Scanning the racks, I was unable to see any clothing that I could wear while preserving my modesty. It isn’t common for modest fashion to be in trendy clothing stores which makes it difficult for young Muslim girls like me to find clothing. Noting this prominent issue of our society, founders Malick and Asma crafted their own clothing brand Fustan. In today’s face-paced world, fashion often overshadows modesty. To bridge this wide gap and provide a solution, Fustan offers clothing that allows individuals to express themselves in a stylish way while staying true to their values. Fustan makes fashionable, comfortable, and easy-to-care-for kurtis. Their greatest goal is to make women feel secure in their modest dressing and be their unapologetic selves! Fueling their new designs and unique ideas, the owners of Fustan strive to inspire, empower, and celebrate the essence of modesty in a modern world. A large part of their business is their all-women staff. From Pakistan, designers and tailors alike spend countless hours discussing with the owners and perfecting the intricacies of their kurtis. From there, they get shipped to San Ramon, California where the owners market and sell their products. Throughout this process is one shared factor: it is run by women, made for women. Fustan not only empowers women to dress modestly while remaining stylish, they also provide opportunities for passionate and creative women as far as Pakistan and to the United States.",
