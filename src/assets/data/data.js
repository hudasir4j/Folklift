      desc: "It was a blazing Summer day when I stepped into the clothing store, preparing for the school year. Scanning the racks, I was unable to see any clothing that I could wear while preserving my modesty. It isn’t common for modest fashion to be in trendy clothing stores which makes it difficult for young Muslim girls like me to find clothing.\nNoting this prominent issue of our society, founders Malick and Asma crafted their own clothing brand Fustan. In today’s face-paced world, fashion often overshadows modesty. To bridge this wide gap and provide a solution, Fustan offers clothing that allows individuals to express themselves in a stylish way while staying true to their values.\n Fustan makes fashionable, comfortable, and easy-to-care-for kurtis. Their greatest goal is to make women feel secure in their modest dressing and be their unapologetic selves! Fueling their new designs and unique ideas, the owners of Fustan strive to inspire, empower, and celebrate the essence of modesty in a modern world. \n A large part of their business is their all-women staff. From Pakistan, designers and tailors alike spend countless hours discussing with the owners and perfecting the intricacies of their kurtis. From there, they get shipped to San Ramon, California where the owners market and sell their products. Throughout this process is one shared factor: it is run by women, made for women. Fustan not only empowers women to dress modestly while remaining stylish, they also provide opportunities for passionate and creative women as far as Pakistan and to the United States.",

Five years ago, inspired by a neighbor's suggestion and driven by the desire to foster genuine connections, Nausheen began matchmaking on platforms like WhatsApp.\n Initially, encounters were casual, with individuals seeking companionship more as a pastime than a serious commitment. Recognizing the need for deeper, more meaningful connections, Nausheen transitioned from a personal endeavor to a full-fledged business. She started conducting interviews with both parents and potential matches, introducing like-minded individuals with the intention of fostering marriages.\n What sets Nausheen's matchmaking business apart is its commitment to sincerity and genuine connections. Nausheen exclusively works with individuals and families who are earnest about marriage within a timeframe of six months to one year. With an average of 20 successful couples per year, the business has grown from a social cause to a professional service, extending its reach nationally.\n Operating as a paid service, Nausheen's matchmaking venture not only brings people together for lifelong companionship but also stands as a testament to her dedication to transforming a personal challenge into a business that facilitates meaningful connections. In a world where the pace of life often hinders the pursuit of genuine relationships, Nausheen's business strives to create lasting unions with a purpose beyond profit.",

      desc: "High school students and undergraduate students often found their own nonprofits for various causes. Whether it's a club spreading awareness about a specific condition, or an organization providing resources to young girls in technology.\nWhile starting these organizations are free, they often times require funding to create an ambitious and tangible impact on the world. The Bee Fund provides just that.\n[h2]Passing The Torch: What Is The Bee Fund?[/h2]\nIsha Sudhir, the founder and Seattle resident, had her fair share of experience in the non-profit space. Previously, she founded the Lotus Project, which was a blood cancer research focused fundraising campaign. Sudhir & her team's efforts allowed them to raise nearly $20,000 in 14 weeks.\nThis experience was formative in her founding of the Bee Fund. She was 'moved by [her and her team's] ability, as the youth, to create such a lasting impact on the lives of many,' Sudhir recollects. Seeing the impact that her team's non-profit work had on others, Sudhir sought to bring similar opportunities and circumstances to others and grow such impacts. 'I founded the Bee Fund with the sole purpose to reduce the barrier to enter the no-profit space,' she states.\nIn a process that is discussed later in this article, judges select non-profits through an application. They provide funding, newsletter exposure, media collaborations, and network opportunities to young founders of non-profits if selected.\n[h2]Isha Sudhir & Entrepreneurship[/h2]\nSudhir is a female founder and has faced many struggles in her journey, despite her overall success. 'Coming from a background in IT work, I had generally been sitting at all male tables,' Sudhir recalls. 'This shift in perspective has been largely beneficial for me.'\nIsha offers advice to young female founders such as herself, especially urging them to join accelerator programs like the Bee Fund which could support them and connect them to a larger community of young entrepreneurs. When developing an initiative, Sudhir's biggest suggestion is for young founders to '[establish] a strong team that holds innovation and inclusion at the forefront of their values,' which can overall prevent workspace discrimination from occurring.\n[h2]What Does The Process Look Like?[/h2]\nAs a large organization, the Bee Fund runs on a team of judges called the 'Board of Judges,' who are 'businesspeople, non-profit chairs, researchers, and industry professionals.' On a monthly basis, these judges meet to hold a vote on project submissions. The submission portal, which will be available to the public on July 28, 2024, is where non-profit owners can submit their applications for them to be reviewed.\nIs the Bee Fund looking for anything specific? 'No, we fund everything from the spark of an idea to a fully-fledged large non-profits. We will give [the initiatives] the tools to scale or fund [their] ideas.' The only strict requirement that the Bee Fund enforces is that the project/non-profit must be youth-led. This includes high school students, as well as undergraduates.\nTo learn more about the Bee Fund, please visit the official website.",

      desc: "Inside a washing machine world, we tremble.\n\nI often worry about my clothes when they are in the washing machine.\nOnce, I sat squatting in front of the soapy round window\nTo take a peek inside the washing machine world\nThat I have to send my clothes to, every week.\n\nMy mother looks at me the same,\nWith more frown lines and less intrigue,\nWhen she sends me outside each day.\n\nOne laundry day, I decided to take my jacket for washing myself.\nAfter all, my mother, too, insists on dropping me herself, wherever she can.\n\nThe fabric drowned it so gently,\nLulled by the quiet gush of murky gray.\nIt lay on top of the washing machine water,\nAbove all the other clothes.\n\nAnd then I just turned on the washing machine timer,\nShifting the knob ever so slightly,\nAnd when I looked to the water again,\nThe jacket was nowhere to be seen.\nIt had been taken under.\n\nA similar shock and fear appears\nIn my mother’s heart\nWhen she does not know my whereabouts;\nOr see me in her line of sight,\nWith her own two eyes.\n\nThat is how muted,\nSoft and corporeal\nMy drowning is.\n\nI talk to my sisters,\nThe women in my world,\nAnd they all tell me\n“Women sink to the bottom of the pile,\nStripped of everything.”\nThat’s just the way it is.\n\nThe places we perceive as safe,\nWhere we go for a certain purpose -\nBe it school, the market or god forbid, the club -\nAre all murky with gray,\nFestering with prey.\nPiercing eyes that leak terror into the air,\nHands that cannot keep to themselves\nAnd minds that roam much farther than they should;\nNo boundaries can be seen in the murky gray waters\nOf the washing machine world,\nThat we wade through each day.\n\nStreetlights, helplines, groups and covered skin,\nThey do not protect us anymore than\nWashing my clothes inside out will.\nIn hot water, clothes bleed out color regardless.\n\nI live in a country that’s ranked\n128th, out of 177,\nOn the women’s peace and security index.\nI live in a world that tells me to get up,\nWhen I’ve been tossed around haphazardly -\nBy hands I do not know and mouths I do not like -\nExpecting me to start anew;\nLike a cloth fresh out of the washing machine.",

      author: "Huda Siraj",
      desc: "I was born a chatty Indian girl in UAE, but later moved to the states in 2012, when I was five. I suppose I hadn’t fully developed an accent at the time given my age, but I found myself speaking differently from my white peers regardless. Pronouncing “water” as “vater” at times (which really embarrassed me into oblivion), or actually pronouncing the ‘l’ in “salmon” and wondering why people would laugh at me. \nThe sad fact is that there are many Nimrata Randhawa’s in the world that want to change their “salmon’s” to “sa-mon’s” and hide away their “Randhawa” identities only to conceal them with “Hayley.”\nThis term — “whitewashed” — has always been confusing to me. White people never told me to speak any different. They laughed, corrected me, and held different perceptions of me, but it was me that annunciated the ‘w’ in “water” desperate to fit in. Moreover, was the way white people spoke a cleanser? Was my Indian-ish accent something that needed to be washed? Why wasn’t it “white-tainted” or “white-soiled?” (Although, I guess nobody says “tainted” or “soiled”).\nHayley is actually one of the first televised “white-washed” brown women, but they exist everywhere. I guess it’s a phase all brown women must adopt before they move on to love their cultures that are built upon centuries of ancestors’ lives.\nWe all pray for the day she metamorphosizes into treating immigrants much like her own parents with the respect and support they deserve and accepts that she is, in truth, a Randhawa at the end of the day.",
