      desc: "It was a blazing Summer day when I stepped into the clothing store, preparing for the school year. Scanning the racks, I was unable to see any clothing that I could wear while preserving my modesty. It isn’t common for modest fashion to be in trendy clothing stores which makes it difficult for young Muslim girls like me to find clothing.\nNoting this prominent issue of our society, founders Malick and Asma crafted their own clothing brand Fustan. In today’s face-paced world, fashion often overshadows modesty. To bridge this wide gap and provide a solution, Fustan offers clothing that allows individuals to express themselves in a stylish way while staying true to their values.\n Fustan makes fashionable, comfortable, and easy-to-care-for kurtis. Their greatest goal is to make women feel secure in their modest dressing and be their unapologetic selves! Fueling their new designs and unique ideas, the owners of Fustan strive to inspire, empower, and celebrate the essence of modesty in a modern world. \n A large part of their business is their all-women staff. From Pakistan, designers and tailors alike spend countless hours discussing with the owners and perfecting the intricacies of their kurtis. From there, they get shipped to San Ramon, California where the owners market and sell their products. Throughout this process is one shared factor: it is run by women, made for women. Fustan not only empowers women to dress modestly while remaining stylish, they also provide opportunities for passionate and creative women as far as Pakistan and to the United States.",

      desc: "In a world where meaningful connections are often lost in the fast pace of life, Nausheen's journey through a personal challenge led to the creation of a unique matchmaking business. Five years ago, inspired by a neighbor's suggestion and driven by the desire to foster genuine connections, Nausheen began matchmaking on platforms like WhatsApp.\n Initially, encounters were casual, with individuals seeking companionship more as a pastime than a serious commitment. Recognizing the need for deeper, more meaningful connections, Nausheen transitioned from a personal endeavor to a full-fledged business. She started conducting interviews with both parents and potential matches, introducing like-minded individuals with the intention of fostering marriages.\n What sets Nausheen's matchmaking business apart is its commitment to sincerity and genuine connections. Nausheen exclusively works with individuals and families who are earnest about marriage within a timeframe of six months to one year. With an average of 20 successful couples per year, the business has grown from a social cause to a professional service, extending its reach nationally.\n Operating as a paid service, Nausheen's matchmaking venture not only brings people together for lifelong companionship but also stands as a testament to her dedication to transforming a personal challenge into a business that facilitates meaningful connections. In a world where the pace of life often hinders the pursuit of genuine relationships, Nausheen's business strives to create lasting unions with a purpose beyond profit.",

'israeli' helicopters dropping papers telling citizens to go South (Al Jazeera, PBS, & Washington Post).\nhowever, i understand why people may feel uncomfortable with posting about this situation. nobody is asking you to post. in fact, don’t. if you are afraid of the backlash, afraid of the people’s negative reactions to your story, don’t post. but NEVER pretend to be an avid and outspoken supporter of Palestine.  if some backlash is making you step away from posting, do NOT bother to post or claim you are a supporter. you’re not woke, you’re not an activist. you’re not a supporter, you are a bandwagon follower.\nin a perfect world, everyone would be boycotting starbucks. but obviously, we don’t live in a perfect world. you can drink starbucks if you would like. personally, i don’t like to drink blood money. but if you want to drink watered-down, overpriced beverages that support the killing of innocent people, go ahead!",
